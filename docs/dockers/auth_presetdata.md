The **Auth** docker connects to the ```auth_user``` DB. This DB is initialized
with following preset data.


## jcp_auth

This DB is used by the [Auth](auth.md) component to store registered users and
clients. Preset data of this DB includes DB's users, tables and a set of data:

**DBMS's User:**<br>
  Username: ```auth_user``` and Password: ```user_auth```

**DB's Tables:**<br>
  The schema contained in DB's preset data is the same of that one
  generated by a clean [KeyCloak 9.0.0](https://www.keycloak.org/archive/documentation-9.0.html)
  installation

**DB's Data:**<br>
  Preset data contains the KeyCloak configuration for development users and
  clients. User ```pinco``` is generic user meanwhile the ```roby``` user act as
  JOSP Cloud administrator. Preset clients are ```test-client-obj``` and
  ```test-client-srv``` respectively for JOD and JSL clients. Moreover, the
  ```test-client-api``` client is used by [JOSP GWs](../jospGWs/README.md) for
  [JCP APIs](../jcpAPIs/README.md) access; and finally the ```test-client-swagger```
