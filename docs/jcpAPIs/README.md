# JCP APIs

The **JCP APIs** is a Spring Boot application that provide JOSP Cloud Platform's
core APIs. These APIs are called exclusively by [JOSP JOD](../jospJOD/README.md)
and [JOSP JSL](../jospJSL/README.md).

The APIs are provided by following controllers:

* [Object](object.md)
* [ObjectPermissions](object_permissions.md)
* [Service](service.md)
* [User](user.md)

- JCP APIs are provided only via [HTTPS](https.md) protocol.
- JCP Clients, before send request to the JCP APIs, must authenticate them self
with the APIs using the [OAuth2](oauth2.md) authentication flows.
- The JCP APIs provides also documentation ([Swagger](swagger.md)) pages self-hosted.
These pages are generated by the Swagger's configuration module of SpringBoot.
- Finally, to store his data, the JCP APIs connects to ["jcp_apis"](db.md) DB.

The JCP APIs share a set of source code files containing classes and definitions
used to call and process APIs queries. This set of source code is called **JCP
APIs Public** and is shared with [JOSP JOD](../jospJOD/README.md) and
[JOSP JSL](../jospJSL/README.md) components as Gradle's dependency.

**NB:** in the 2.0.0 version of JCP APIs, it includes also the [JOSP GWs](../jospGWs/README.md).

**Versions:**

* v. 2.0.0:
  initial version that provide JCP APIs v 2.0 used by JOSP JOD v. 2.0.0,
  JOSP JSL v. 2.0.0 and JOSP GWs v. 2.0.0

## Gradle tasks

### Runner tasks

During the JCP APIs startup, it connects to the DBMS and (if not) initialize
the ```jcp_apis``` DB's tables; and start listening for incoming HTTPS requests.

---
```./gradlew jcpAPI_Start```

startup the Spring Boot application for JCP APIs.
the JCP APIs's default port is ```9001```

---
```./gradlew jcpAPI_Stop```

halt the Spring Boot application for JCP APIs.
**NB:** not yet implemented (kill ps).


### Cleaner tasks

```./gradlew jcpAPI_Clean```

delete all tables from the ```jcp_apis``` DB.
**NB:** not yet implemented (missing sql statements).


### Publish tasks

The JCP APIs Public can publish only "src" and "docs" packages. The binary
package is not provided because the other JOSP components resolve the dependencies
via JOSP Commons's sourceSet output.

---
```./gradlew jcpAPI_PublishToLocal```

generate the Java docs of the JCP APIs Public source code, pack them in a jar
archive, like the source code files; and publish them to local maven repo.

---
```./gradlew jcpAPI_PublishToSonatype```

generate the Java docs of the JCP APIs Public source code, pack them in a jar
archive, like the source code files; and publish them to public Sonatype repo.
